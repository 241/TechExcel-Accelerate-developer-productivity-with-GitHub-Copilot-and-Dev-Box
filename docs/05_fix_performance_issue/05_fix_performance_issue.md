# Exercise 05 - Fix a performance issue using GitHub Copilot

## Lab Scenario

Now that Application Insights has been deployed, you can use it to uncover performance issues in the application. This, combined with GitHub Copilot, can be a powerful technique for discovering and correcting performance issues in code. You will then see how to deploy additional resources, such as Azure Cache for Redis, as part of an existing infrastructure as code solution, offering the opportunity to enhance performance through specialized software. Finally, you will ensure that .NET unit tests are running as part of the automated build process.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Use Application Insights to find a performance issue.
* Use GitHub Copilot to discover code and improve the performance of existing code.
* Deploy resources like Azure Cache for Redis as part of an existing infrastructure as code solution.
* Ensure .NET unit tests are running as part of the automated build process.

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 90 minutes
